    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Mohammed elamin Hamrit and I am studying interactive media and web development. I enjoy learning how websites
        are built and how structure helps organize information clearly. This course is helping me understand the basics
        of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and how to create clean and meaningful pages that are easy
        to read and accessible for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to improve my coding skills every day and become confident in both design and programming. I believe
        that practice is <em>very important</em> for success. This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> website project, and I am excited
        to continue learning new technologies and building creative web experiences in the future.
